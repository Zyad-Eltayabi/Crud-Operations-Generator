<h1 align="center">Crud Operations Generator</h1> 

## Description
Crud Operations Generator is a powerful and efficient tool designed to automate the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for ADO.NET applications. This project simplifies database interaction by generating robust, ready-to-use methods for managing database records with minimal effort.

## Key Features
- **Database Exploration**: Retrieve all database names, tables, and their columns, including detailed properties such as column name, data type, and nullability.  
- **CRUD Operation Generation**: Automatically generate methods for essential database operations, including:
  - **Create**: Add new records.  
  - **Read**: Fetch specific or all records (e.g., **Get All Clients**).  
  - **Update**: Modify existing records.  
  - **Delete**: Remove records.  
  - **IsExist**: Check if a record exists.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface allows users to seamlessly generate and copy the CRUD code for use in their projects.  
- **Code Efficiency**: Focus on generating highly efficient, reusable, and maintainable database interaction methods to save development time.
